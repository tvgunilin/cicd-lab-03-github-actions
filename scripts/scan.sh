# Tell the gateway to scan project files AND gateway config, picking up changes
# you've made under projects/ — no restart needed. Run this after editing a
# view or a script. Two scans, two jobs: a project scan reloads views &
# scripts, a config scan reloads gateway config files.
#
# Why this exists: a running gateway does NOT auto-detect edits to the
# bind-mounted project files; you have to trigger a scan (or restart it).
#
# One-time setup: the scan API needs an API key whose security level has
# gateway write permission. In the gateway UI (http://localhost:8088):
#   1. Config → Security → Security Levels: add a custom level, e.g. "Scan"
#   2. Config → Security → Security Settings: add that level to
#      Gateway Write Permissions (the scan routes check write permission)
#   3. Config → Security → API Keys → Create: grant the "Scan" level, and
#      disable "Require secure connections for API Keys" (this lab's gateway
#      is plain http)
#   4. Copy the generated key — it has the form <name>:<secret> — into .env as:
#      IGNITION_API_KEY=<value>
