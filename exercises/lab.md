# Lab 03 — GitHub Actions

**A hands-on workshop.** One continuous arc: take the Ignition project you already
know and build a **CI safety net** around it — local linters first, then a GitHub
Actions workflow that makes those checks a required gate on every PR, then a look at
*where* CI runs when GitHub-hosted isn't enough.

> The subject is the same Ignition gateway and Perspective project from Lab 02 (a
> cold-storage "Overview" HMI plus two Jython script libraries). You're not learning
> new application code — you're adding CI around code you already understand. The repo
> tracks only the project files under `projects/`; the gateway generates its own config
> into a Docker volume we never commit. (Lab 04 goes deep on that file layout.)

**What this lab is — and isn't.** Today you build the *safety net*: CI that catches problems
in your project files before they ship. You won't deploy anything to a gateway yet —
automated, file-based deployment is the subject of Labs 04–05. The goal here is to make
"broken project files can't reach `main`" automatic.

## What you'll do

- **Part 1 — Linters as your safety net:** yamllint, shellcheck, actionlint, **ign-lint**, `ops/validate.sh`
- **Part 2 — GitHub Actions:** build `ci.yml`, path filters, required check
- **Part 3 — Self-hosted runners:** a look ahead (short demo) — hands-on comes in Labs 04–05

## Setup

You'll need Docker (Compose V2) and Python 3.10+. Clone, copy the env file, and confirm
the gateway boots:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
ops/setup.sh        # boots one Ignition gateway, waits for RUNNING, prints the URL + login
# open http://localhost:8088  → log in with the .env credentials
```

Install the linters (macOS shown; Linux/Codespaces use `apt`/release tarballs):

```bash
brew install shellcheck actionlint

python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install yamllint==1.35.1 ign-lint==0.6.1     # ign-lint needs Python 3.10+
```

> **Why the venv?** A bare `pip install` on Homebrew or Ubuntu 24.04+ Python fails with
> `error: externally-managed-environment` (PEP 668); the venv sidesteps that and keeps
> the lab's pinned tool versions out of your system Python. `.venv/` is already
> gitignored. Re-activate in new terminals with `source .venv/bin/activate`. On a
> minimal Debian/Ubuntu box, install the venv module first: `sudo apt install
> python3-venv`. (Skip `brew install yamllint` — the pinned pip version is the one CI uses.)

> **About `ign-lint`:** it's the one Ignition-specific tool here — a young, pre-1.0 linter
> (v0.6.1) from [BW Design Group](https://github.com/bw-design-group)
> ([ignition-lint repo](https://github.com/bw-design-group/ignition-lint)). It's the best
> Ignition-native linter going today, which is why we use it; pin the version and treat it as
> a great example of the *pattern* — an Ignition-aware linter as a required CI check — rather
> than a permanent dependency.

### Your own repo (needed for Part 2)

Part 2 has you open pull requests and set a *required status check* on `main` — both need
a repo **you** control (you need admin rights to configure branch protection). Either fork
this lab or create a fresh repo from your clone:

```bash
# Option A — fork it to your own account
gh repo fork Mustry-Academy/cicd-lab-03-github-actions --clone

# Option B — create your own repo from this clone
gh repo create <you>/cicd-lab-03 --private --source=. --push
```

Open PRs inside your own copy: you own it, so you can configure branch protection and merge
your own PRs once CI is green.

## Part 1 — Linters as your safety net

**Goal:** run yamllint, shellcheck, actionlint, **ign-lint**, and `ops/validate.sh`
against a real Ignition project; read each tool's output; decide whether to fix,
configure away, or ignore each finding; and tune `.yamllint.yml` to fit the project.

Every linter is a cheap, fast check that catches one class of bug. The point isn't to
run them all — it's to know which one would have caught yesterday's regression.

### Seed the broken state

```bash
ops/seed.sh
```

This plants a handful of issues into your working tree — at least one for every tool,
including three realistic Ignition findings in the Perspective view: a **brittle, broken
binding**, a **runaway poll rate**, and a **mis-named component**. Hunt them down with the
linters. Reset to a clean tree
any time with:

```bash
git restore . && rm -f .github/workflows/example.yml
```

### I do

The instructor live-demos on the seeded state. For each tool: run it, read the output,
fix one finding.

1. `yamllint -c .yamllint.yml docker-compose.yml` — YAML syntax + style (finds trailing whitespace).
2. `ops/validate.sh` — the gateway-free green/red signal: every `*.json` under `projects/`
   is valid JSON, every `code.py` parses as Python 3. Exit 0 = green, 1 = red. The same
   check the PR uses.
3. `ign-lint --config rule_config.json --files "projects/**/view.json"` — **the flagship
   tool of this part.** Ignition-native static analysis: it parses the Perspective
   `view.json`, walks the component tree, and checks naming conventions, binding poll
   rates, brittle references, and the Python embedded in views — all without a running
   gateway.
4. `actionlint` — GitHub Actions workflow syntax + expression typing (run it on the seeded `example.yml`).
5. `shellcheck ops/*.sh` — catches almost every shell scripting bug ever made.

Spend the most time on **ign-lint** — it's the one that's genuinely Ignition-aware, and
the one most people here have never seen. Open `rule_config.json` and walk the rules:
`NamePatternRule` (components → PascalCase, properties → camelCase, message handlers →
kebab-case, custom methods → snake_case), `PollingIntervalRule` (a floor on binding poll
rates — 1000 ms here), `BadComponentReferenceRule` (flags `.getSibling()` / `.getParent()`
traversal), `PylintScriptRule`, and the rest. The clean `lab-project` passes ign-lint with
**zero** findings — every finding you see is something `ops/seed.sh` broke on purpose.

### You do

Fix the remaining planted issues, then make the config your own.

1. Run each of `yamllint`, `shellcheck`, `actionlint`, `ign-lint`, and `ops/validate.sh`,
   and write down each finding — make a list.
2. Fix every finding. For each, record: *what the tool flagged*, *why your fix is correct*,
   and *what class of production bug it would catch*.
3. Re-run every linter until each is silent and `ops/validate.sh` exits 0.
4. Open `.yamllint.yml`. We disabled `line-length` for the project — **extend the comment**
   explaining *why* (hint: long compose environment lines).
5. Commit. Your end state should be a clean tree: every linter silent, `ops/validate.sh`
   exits 0.

> Stuck on a finding? [`instructor-notes/lab-key.md`](../instructor-notes/lab-key.md) has the
> walkthrough — but give it a genuine attempt yourself first; the diagnostic skill is most
> of the lesson.

### Debrief

- Which of these linters would have caught the most recent real bug your team shipped?
- When does linting *hurt* instead of help? (When it flags style as errors; when it's
  slower than the dev loop; when its config drifts from reality.)
- ign-lint is new to most of you: which of its rules map to a mistake you've actually
  shipped in a Perspective project? Which feel like overreach?

## Part 2 — GitHub Actions: workflows, jobs, required checks

**Goal:** write a workflow from scratch with sensible defaults (PR trigger,
least-privilege permissions, path filters), wire in the Part 1 linters, and make the
whole thing a *required check* no one can merge past.

Start from a clean tree (Part 1 fixes applied, `.yamllint.yml` in place).

### I do

The mental model:

```
workflow  ──contains──▶  jobs  ──contains──▶  steps  ──run──▶  actions or shell commands
   │                       │                      │
   │                       │                      └── env, working-directory…
   │                       └── runs-on, needs, strategy, permissions
   └── on (triggers), permissions, concurrency
```

Live-create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, starting with the gateway-free validator:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
permissions:
  contents: read
jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: ops/validate.sh
```

Open a PR, watch it run, read the logs together — each step is its own collapsible block.
Then add a second job that runs the Part 1 linters, including `ign-lint`:

```yaml
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10   # this job installs tools; give it more headroom than validate
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.12"
      - run: pip install yamllint==1.35.1 ign-lint==0.6.1
      - run: yamllint -c .yamllint.yml .
      - uses: raven-actions/actionlint@v2
      - run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends shellcheck
      - run: shellcheck ops/*.sh
      - run: ign-lint --config rule_config.json --files "projects/**/view.json"
```

`ign-lint` needs Python 3.10+, which is why we pin `setup-python` to `"3.12"`. Discuss as
you go:

- **`permissions: contents: read`** — least privilege; the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is too broad.
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** — auto-provisioned per job, scoped to the repo, expires when the job ends.
- **Secrets vs variables** — secrets are encrypted and masked (`***`) in logs; variables
  are plain text. Live-add an `EXAMPLE_SECRET` and confirm it's masked.
- **Job ids are check names** — branch protection (You-do step 4) matches status checks
  by name, and a job's name *is* its id (`lint`, `validate`) unless you override it with
  `name:`. Rename a job later and any required check pointing at the old name waits forever.
- **`timeout-minutes`** — a hung job otherwise runs (and bills) for up to 6 hours;
  capping every job is free insurance. Size it per job: a required check that flakes
  because a slow apt mirror blew a too-tight cap blocks the whole team.

### You do

Make the workflow yours.

**1 — Path filters.** Add a `paths:` filter so the workflow skips docs-only PRs:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - "projects/**"
      - "ops/**"
      - "docker-compose.yml"
      - ".github/workflows/**"
      - ".yamllint.yml"
      - "rule_config.json"
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

Open a PR that touches **only** `README.md` and confirm the workflow is **skipped** (not
just passed). Hold that thought — it collides with required checks in step 4.

**2 — Compose validation.** Add a final step to the lint job:

```yaml
      - run: docker compose config -q
```

This catches Compose-level issues yamllint can't see — undefined services, port-string
typos, malformed environment maps.

**3 — Status badge.** Add a CI badge to the top of `README.md`:

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/<you>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/<you>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

(`<your-repo>` is whatever you created in Setup — `cicd-lab-03-github-actions` for a
fork, `cicd-lab-03` if you followed Option B. A wrong repo name gives a silently broken
badge, not an error.)

**4 — Required check.** In repo settings, configure branch protection on `main`: require a
PR before merging, and require status checks — select **`lint`** and **`validate`**. Now
introduce a failure — run `ops/seed.sh` to plant the broken state (or just set the Clock's
poll to `now(250)` by hand) — commit it, and open a PR. Confirm GitHub blocks the merge.
Fix and re-push.

> **The trap you just set.** Required checks and `paths:` filters interact badly. Your
> docs-only PR from step 1 was *skipped* — but a required check that never reports
> doesn't pass, it stays **"Expected — waiting for status" forever**. Try it: open
> another README-only PR now and watch it hang. With branch protection on, nobody can
> merge a docs-only change without an admin override. GitHub's documented fix is a
> **twin no-op workflow** with the **same job names** — the job name is what a required
> check matches on — and an inverse `paths-ignore:` filter, so it reports an instant
> green `lint` and `validate` on exactly the PRs the real CI skips
> ([Handling skipped but required checks](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/troubleshooting-required-status-checks#handling-skipped-but-required-checks)).
> Building it is a stretch goal below; for this lab repo it's also fine to just
> understand *why* the PR hangs — this exact interaction bites real teams.

**5 — Sanity check.** Commit any remaining changes. Your workflow should *structurally*
match the shipped [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) — same
triggers, jobs, and step order; step `name:` labels and comments may differ — see
[`instructor-notes/lab-key.md`](../instructor-notes/lab-key.md) for the reference end state.

### Stretch `[OPTIONAL]`

- **Fix the docs-only-PR hang** with the no-op twin from the step 4 callout: a second
  workflow whose `paths-ignore:` mirrors the real filter list, with jobs named exactly
  `lint` and `validate` that just `echo` and exit 0 — the *job* names are what the
  required checks match on (the workflow's `name:` is cosmetic). Mind the caveat in
  GitHub's docs: a PR touching both docs *and* code triggers both workflows, and two
  check runs then report under each name.
- **Matrix `ign-lint` over individual views** so each view surfaces as its own check — a
  one-entry matrix today, but the pattern that scales as the HMI grows. (For now the single
  globbed step is plenty; the matrix is about isolating *which* view broke, not speed.)
- **Cancel superseded runs.** Add a workflow-level `concurrency:` group
  (`group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}`, `cancel-in-progress: true`) so a
  force-push doesn't leave a stale run burning minutes — the `concurrency` box from the
  mental-model diagram, in practice.
- **Read, don't implement:** the difference between `on: pull_request` and
  `on: pull_request_target`. The latter runs the base-branch workflow *with secrets*
  against the PR's code — a well-known privilege-escalation footgun. See the
  [GitHub Security Lab post](https://securitylab.github.com/resources/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/).

### Debrief

- Where does the workflow actually run? (An ephemeral runner spun up per job.)
- What happens when a step fails midway? A whole job? (`continue-on-error`, `needs:`.)
- Required checks are a contract with the *team*, not just a setting — who decides what's blocking?
- We pin pip packages to an exact version but actions to a mutable tag (`@v4`). What's the
  difference in risk? (A tag can be moved by the action's owner; supply-chain-sensitive repos
  pin actions to a full commit SHA and let Dependabot bump them. This matters more once a
  self-hosted runner sits inside a plant network — Part 3.)

---

## Part 3 — Self-hosted runners (a look ahead)

The instructor closes with a short tour of self-hosted runners: what they are and when you'd
reach for one. You'll get **hands-on** with them in Labs 04–05 — deploying to a real gateway
usually means a runner that can reach it — so here we just establish the idea and the one rule
that matters.

**When GitHub-hosted is enough — most of the time.** Your code lints and validates on a
standard image and you're not blocked by network or compliance. Use GitHub-hosted and move on.

**When you need self-hosted.** The big one for Ignition is **network isolation**: the gateway
you deploy to sits behind a firewall (on-prem, a customer VPN, a private PLC network) that a
GitHub-hosted runner can't reach. (Also: compliance / data residency, real hardware, and cost
at very high volume.)

**The one rule to remember.** A self-hosted runner executes arbitrary workflow code on a
machine inside your network. *Never* attach one to a **public** repo that accepts **fork PRs**
— a malicious PR can run code on your network. Use *ephemeral* runners and trusted repos.

**Short demo (instructor).** Register an ephemeral Docker runner, route one job to it, watch
it run locally:

```bash
# short-lived registration token
export RUNNER_TOKEN="$(gh api -X POST \
  "repos/<user>/<repo>/actions/runners/registration-token" --jq .token)"

docker run -d --rm --name lab03-runner \
  -e REPO_URL="https://github.com/<user>/<repo>" \
  -e RUNNER_TOKEN="$RUNNER_TOKEN" \
  -e LABELS="self-hosted,local-lab03" \
  -e EPHEMERAL=true \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  myoung34/github-runner:latest

docker logs -f lab03-runner          # watch for "Listening for Jobs"
```

A one-step workflow with `runs-on: [self-hosted, local-lab03]`, triggered via `gh workflow
run`, then executes live in `docker logs`. Note the runner only has what you put on it (no
preinstalled `shellcheck`, for instance). The full how-to — registering, routing, and cleaning
up — is in [`docs/self-hosted-runners.md`](../docs/self-hosted-runners.md), and you'll do it
for real in Lab 04.

**Discussion.** Which of *your own* deploys would need a self-hosted runner — and why,
specifically? ("Our gateway is behind the customer's VPN; GitHub-hosted physically can't reach
it" beats "maybe.")

---

## Wrap-up & take-home

You built a CI safety net for an Ignition project, end to end:

- **Local linters** — yamllint, shellcheck, actionlint, **ign-lint**, and `ops/validate.sh`
  — each catching a class of bug before it ships.
- **A GitHub Actions workflow** that runs them on every PR, with least-privilege permissions,
  path filters, and a status badge.
- **A required check** that turns "please run the linters" into "you cannot merge until they pass."
- **An understanding of self-hosted runners** — when they're worth it, and the security
  weight they carry.

**Before Lab 04:** skim [`docs/self-hosted-runners.md`](../docs/self-hosted-runners.md) — you'll register a real runner there.

**What's next:** Lab 04 opens up the Ignition file structure itself — `project.json`, view
exports, and how to deploy project files to a gateway properly — building on the CI
foundation you just laid.
