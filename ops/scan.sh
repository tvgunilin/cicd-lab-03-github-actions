# Tell the gateway to scan project files and pick up changes you've made under
# projects/ — no restart needed. Run this after editing a view or a script.
#
# Why this exists: a running gateway does NOT auto-detect edits to the
# bind-mounted project files; you have to trigger a scan (or restart it).
#
# One-time setup: the scan API needs an API key. In the gateway UI
# (http://localhost:8088) go to Config → Security → API Keys → Create, give it
# Project Scan permission, and add the value to .env as:
#     IGNITION_API_KEY=<value>
